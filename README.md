# Hi there!  :)

I'm doing my Masters in Mechanical Engineering (research about convolutional neural networks), I teach machine learning introduction as part of the university's extension program and I also do freelance work in Data Science, some of my consulting projects:

```
-> Grid optimization of university disciplines using natural language processing
-> Detection of failures by image processing
-> Report optimization using data engineering
-> Research, correlation and regression of variables to calculate ROI in product development
-> Gamification projects over business process.
```

## Contents

Here at my GIT you can see (and download) some of the projects that I made (although some datasets are private).
They are organized in the following folders:

### Convolutional Neural Network - Usinagem

The objective of this study is to implement and test the accuracy of a convolutional neural network under the task of evaluating the adhesion incidence over microscope images of manufacturing. The algorithm was trained over 140 different microscope images, from different resolutions and different directions through 100 epochs; this resulted in a training score of 96.95% (overall accuracy). After the training, a test over other new 40 images was performed, and the accuracy results obtained are 96.77%

### Grid optimization

In this project, we optimized the grid of disciplines from an university using natural language processing on the content of each class, we run over 13000 disciplines of 273 curricular structures and found 7272 cases where the similarity was superior of 80%.

### Medical Survey Correlation

We evaluate the correlation between over 132 medical questions in a dataset of 900 lines, to verify opportunities of optimization. After that, regressions and A/B tests were performeds to validate the insights

### Analysis of Variance

Data engineering, Normality assessment, Hypothesis testing, EDA (exploratory data analysis) and Analysis of Variance - we ran the tests using more than 120 xls spreadsheets provided by the company

### Others

You can still check other algorithms, distributed in folders, such as "alice-s-text-analysis" - extracting and processing text using the classic children's book...
